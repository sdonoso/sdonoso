### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Engineer from the University of Chile. I have worked as a software developer and machine learning engineer. My experience is mainly focused on NLP, including pretraining, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and model alignment.

I'm particularly interested in the intersection of software development and machine learning, especially in building applications powered by ML and generative models.
